# Big-Query-Projects
This project involves the development of an Exam Analysis and Performance Tracking System using BigQuery to process and analyze educational data. The system calculates the actual marks for students in each exam session, classifies them based on their performance (Pass/Fail), ranks the top performers and tracks their performance trends across exams.
